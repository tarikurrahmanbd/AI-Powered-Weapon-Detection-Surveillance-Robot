# 🔫 AI-Powered Weapon Detection & Surveillance Robot

An advanced, real-time security and surveillance robot system integrating state-of-the-art computer vision with hardware automation. This project utilizes custom-trained **YOLOv12** models to detect weapons in real-time and communicates with an **Arduino**-controlled robotic platform for active response and surveillance.
